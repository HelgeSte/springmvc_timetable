# springmvc_timetable
New timetable project based for testing out the code in the LinkedIn Learnings course Spring: Spring MVC

Going to create a basic timetable project with a webgui by using springmvc. This is done to test out what I learn from the 
'Spring: Springmvc' course from LinkedIn Learning: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spring-spring-mvc-2.
